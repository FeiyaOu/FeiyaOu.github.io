description: This website project for TypeMind is inspired by the growing popularity of the MBTI in both professional settings and everyday life. The site is divided into four sections, including a simple game, an introduction to fundamental MBTI concepts, four videos exploring the topic, and a survey to gather user opinions on MBTI. This project serves as a practical exercise in responsive design, as well as in fundamental JavaScript and HTML skills.
