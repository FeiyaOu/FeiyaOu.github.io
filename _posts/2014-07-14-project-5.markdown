description: This project is a practice exercise from an online JavaScript course by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy. It involves creating a simple web-based number guessing game that utilizes fundamental JavaScript skills in DOM manipulation and event handling, along with CSS for styling. I also made some layout changes to enhance the UI/UX.
